        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put shrimp in a zip-top bag set in a shallow dish. Add oil, 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, the orange juice, lime zest, lime juice, and garlic. Seal bag; turn to coat. Chill at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>

            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat (350 degrees F to 375 degrees F/175 degrees C to 190 degrees C). Remove shrimp from marinade, discarding marinade. Thread 6 to 7 shrimp onto each of 4 skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Oil grill grates. Arrange skewers; orange wedges, cut sides down; and thyme on grill. Grill thyme just until lightly charred, about 15 seconds. Cover grill. Grill skewers and orange wedges, turning halfway through, until shrimp are opaque and orange wedges are lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>

            <li>Strip thyme leaves from sprigs; coarsely chop. Stir 1 teaspoon chopped thyme and remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest into butter.</li>

            <li>Spread citrus-thyme butter over shrimp and serve with orange wedges. Garnish with remaining thyme.</li>
