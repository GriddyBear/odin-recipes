        <h3>These baked burger dogs, hot dog-shaped burgers that are baked in the oven, are great for when the cookout gets rained out, or when you want to impress your guests, or just confuse your kids. The taste and texture may remind you of White Castle burgers.</h3>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or oil, divided</li>
            <l1>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</l1>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/3 cup finely diced red onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup diced dill or sweet pickles, well drained</li>
            <li>6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a large 15x10-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon melted butter or oil.</li>

            <li>Add beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, red onion, pickles, and 4 ounces shredded cheese to a bowl, and use a fork to mix until all ingredients are evenly combined.</li>

            <li>Divide beef mixture into 8 equal portions. Using damp fingers, shape 1 portion into a log and gently press onto the bottom of a hot dog bun. Lightly press bun together, trapping the meat, and place stuffed bun in the baking dish with meat facing straight up. Repeat until all 8 buns are stuffed.</li>

            <li>Brush all exposed areas of buns with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter or oil, and sprinkle over remaining 2 ounces of cheese.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meat is no longer pink at the center, and buns are golden brown and crispy on the edges, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Serve immediately with classic burger and hot dog toppings and condiments.</li>
